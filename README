This is a tool to read coverage and figleaf data and report on it.

However, unlike those tools, coverage-reporter provides the ability to munge the
data on the way to reporting as desired.

For example, you can specify that you wish to only see the coverage for your
current patch by specifying:

git diff | coverage-reporter --patch=stdin --patch-level=0 --summarize --annotate .

This will take the patch from git, read it and then only provide coverage
information on those lines affected by your patch.

Another useful command is --minimum-missing=100 - if you have a large number of
covered files, this will limit the display to only those missing more than 100
lines of coverage.  Also useful is --minimum-missing=1, which doesn't print any
status for those files that are completely covered.
