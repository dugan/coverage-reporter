Meant to be tested with "unit2 discover".

In order to get coverage numbers, you'll need the unittest2 plugins branch.

Add the coverage_reporter.extras.unittest2_plugin to your plugin list (remove
the testcoverage one which uses coverage's built-in reporting) and run with
--coverage.

Afterwards, run bin/coverage-reporter . (there is a .coverage_reporter file in this
directory that contains coverage reporter config)
